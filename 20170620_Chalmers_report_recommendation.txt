Presbytery of Melbourne East
Chalmers Interim Moderator's Report

Comments in advance of Presbytery 21 Jun 2017

Date 20 Jun 2017

1. The report lacks any form of backgrounding, SWOT analysis, or recognition of where the congregation stands at present.
For example, there is no evidence of the options available to the congregation which might include (in descending order of severity):
a) closing down
b) selling the property/ies and relocating to a new area entirely, 
c) seeking new premises in the same area
d) joining with another congregation
etc.,
and which the Board and Session have considered before adopting the present plan.
2. There are 15 regular attenders out of a roll of 21. There is no identification of local demographics to form the source of the new converts growth envisaged. There is only an implicit reference to a) Swinburne Uni and b) a local primary school as the main source of attenders.
3. Is the five year span of the present plan sufficient to move the congregation from vacancy to a large-scale vibrant community of Spirit-motivated believers?
4. The report refers to $40,000 per annum to be drawn from Sites Reserve to fund shortfalls in operational expenditure. The main item would be Terms of Settlement but is there any budget for the plan period so that the Board can foresee other areas of expense to be covered from the $40,000?
5. Is there any understanding of other capital expenditure which may be required on the buildings or other facilities to accommodate the planned expansion?

In the absence of answers to these kinds of questions, it would be a brave Presbytery which would endorse the present proposal. I would recommend referring the plan back to the Session, Board and congregation for more work to be done.
