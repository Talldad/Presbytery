Moderator, the Presbytery account balance as reported at the previous meeting was $3675.92.

Since then proceeds of four levies for the current year have been banked and the balance as at the end of July was $4275.92.

Delivery of the payment for the audit was overlooked but will be completed in the next few days or so.

There being no further activity, I move that the report be received.

John Angelico
Treasurer
