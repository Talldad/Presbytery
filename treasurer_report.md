Moderator, the Presbytery account balance as reported at the December meeting was $4670.92, unchanged from the previous report.

Since then no further deposits have been made; that is, I have received no more levies, and again there was no interest paid across the entire period.

The payments approved have all been made and the cheques presented, so that the balance fell as predicted to $1970.92, where it remains as at the end of January.

I move that the report be received.

I further move that the Clerk's expenses for the entire year 2017 as detailed in his spreadsheet be paid in the sum of $169.70.
