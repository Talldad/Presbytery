Moderator, the Presbytery account balance reported to the Februrary meeting was $7917.72.

The Clerk's expenses of $77.40 have been paid as per the last report, and there has been one deposit for $625.05 from the Licencing Service for Oliver Blythe and Dong Choi.

Whilst I do not have a bank statement as yet, the balance at the end of March is expected to be $8465.37.

I move 
1. that the report be received;

2. that the books be closed for the year ended 31st March and presented for audit to Mr Dennis Wright;

and

3. that the levy for 2021 be waived, in view of the healthy condition of the bank account.


John Angelico
Treasurer
