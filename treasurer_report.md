Moderator, my report this meeting comes in two parts: bank activity since the February meeting and a report for the full year, presented as an annual statement.

1. Since last Ordinary meeting
The Presbytery account balance as reported at the February meeting was $1970.92.

Since then we have deposited the proceeds of the licensing service at Balwyn, totalling $511, and paid out expenses for the Clerk plus gift bibles for the students now licensed.

The closing bank balance as at the end of March was $2312.22, awaiting one cheque for $85 to be presented.

I move that the report be received.

2. Annual Report & Budget
The Annual Statement of Income and Expenditure has been circulated along with a proposed budget for 2018-19.

After taking questions, if any.
I move 
a) that the Annual Report be adopted, subject to audit
b) that the report and all relevant supporting documents be submitted to Dennis K Wright & Associates for audit
c) that the proposed Budget be adopted, and 
d) that the Presbytery levy for 2018-19 be retained at $150 per parish.
