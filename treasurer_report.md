Moderator, the Presbytery account balance reported at the October 2018 meeting was $6867.92, and I apologise to the Presbytery for not delivering a report at the December meeting.

Since then the following deposits have been lodged:
a) offerings from induction services - Surrey Hills John Hyunh 976.80 and Ashburton Barry Oakes $755
b) one levy paid (Korean) $150 

Cheques drawn for the Clerk's honorarium $1200 and the annual audit $66 were presented
and the balance as at this meeting is therefore $7483.72.

I move that the report be received.

I further move that the Presbytery make a contribution towards the students under our jurisdiction of $1500 each in support of their continuing studies and preparation for ministry of the Word

John Angelico
Treasurer
