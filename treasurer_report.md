Moderator, the Presbytery account balance as reported at the previous meeting was $4670.92.

Since then no further deposits have been made; that is, I have received no more levies.

Again there was no interest paid across the entire period.

Due to my oversight and extreme busiy-ness the payments approved at the last regular meeting have only been made tonight and, as a consequence, the account balance on the statement as at the end of November remained unchanged at $4670.92.

Subsequent to this meeting the balance will fall to 1970.92.

I move that the report be received.
