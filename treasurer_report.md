Moderator, the Presbytery account balance reported to the December meeting was $7917.72.

There has been no activity across the summer period, and the balance as at this meeting, therefore, remains $7917.72.

The Clerk has presented his claim for expenses, totalling $77.40, reflecting the lower cost of conducting most correspondence by email.

A cheque has been drawn as reimbursement and should be presented at the bank shortly.

I move that the report be received.

John Angelico
Treasurer
