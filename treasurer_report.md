Moderator, the Presbytery account balance reported to the August meeting was $6149.37, confirmed by a statement for August, which was received subsequent to the meeting.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, I have received no further bank statements, although recent easing of travel limitations should overcome some of these difficulties in future. 

Since there has been no subsequent activity, the balance of the account as at this date remains $6149.37.

I move that the report be received;

John Angelico
Treasurer
