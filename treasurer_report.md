Moderator, the Presbytery account balance as at 31st January was $3284.82, reported in the February meeting as unchanged from November 2016.

Since then the Clerk's expenses have been approved and paid, and the balance as at the end of March became $3040.92.

There being no further business since then, I am confident the balance remains the same today.

I move that the Treasurer's report be received.

John Angelico
Treasurer
