Moderator, the Presbytery account balance reported to the April meeting was $8465.37.

I now have bank statements to the end of May, with no activity since what was reported to the April meeting. 

The balance at the end of May is confirmed to be $8465.37.

In accordance with the resolution of the April meeting I report that the Clerk's honorarium has not been paid for 2019 ($1500) on the basis that the Clerk specifically informed me that he waived his entitlement due to absence caused by his hospitalisation.

Additionally there has been no payment as yet of the usual instalment ($750) for 2020 to date.

If it is the mind of the Presbytery to affirm the payment of 2019 honorarium, then a cheque can be prepared after the meeting to include that amount along with the instalment normally due at this time.

I move  that the report be received;


John Angelico
Treasurer
