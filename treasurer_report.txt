Moderator, the Presbytery account balance reported to the July meeting was $7733.72.

Since then another three levy payments totalling $150 have been deposited and the auditor's fee has been paid as resolved at the last meeting.

The balance as at this meeting is therefore $7817.72.

I move that the report be received.


John Angelico
Treasurer
