Moderator, the Presbytery account balance as at 31st March was $3040.92, reported in the April meeting.

Since then proceeds of the licensing service ($385 as reported at that meeting) were deposited and the balance as at the end of May was $3425.92.

Just a couple of days ago one levy cheque was deposited and the balance today would be $3675.92.

I have received the audit report on last year's accounts, and am relieved to report that the accounts are all in order according to him.

He has returned last year's records along with his account of $55.

I therefore move 
1. that the Treasurer's report be received
and
2 that the audit fee of $55 be paid.

John Angelico
Treasurer
